# GalaxyGram

GalaxyGram is an Android app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt, and Retrofit.  
It connects to NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API and provides a feed of daily images with detailed information.

The project demonstrates modern Android development best practices:

- MVVM architecture with ViewModel and StateFlow  
- Hilt for dependency injection (built on top of Dagger 2)  
- Retrofit and Moshi for networking and JSON parsing  
- Jetpack Compose for declarative UI  
- Coil for image loading  
- Unit testing with JUnit, Coroutines Test, and Mockito  

---

## Features

- Browse the latest NASA APOD images in a scrollable feed  
- View additional details such as title, date, and description  
- Loading and error handling via a sealed UiState  
- Repository pattern to separate concerns  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin  
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose, Material 3  
- **Architecture:** MVVM  
- **Networking:** Retrofit, OkHttp, Moshi  
- **Dependency Injection:** Hilt

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Junaid2478/GalaxyGram.git

2. Obtain a NASA API key from api.nasa.gov and add it to local.properties

3. Open the project in Android Studio and run it on a device or emulator (API 24+).

Purpose

This project was developed as a demonstration of clean Android architecture, API integration, and testing practices.
It can serve as a learning project, interview skeleton, or foundation for further exploration./GalaxyGram.git
